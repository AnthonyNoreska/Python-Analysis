# Python-Analysis

Overview

Here, you'll find two projects showcasing my skills in data analysis and scripting: PyBank and PyPoll. Each project addresses real-world scenarios and demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming for data manipulation and analysis.

Project Highlights
PyBank
Objective

Analyze financial records to derive key insights.
Key Achievements

    Determined the total number of months in the dataset.
    Calculated the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
    Computed changes in "Profit/Losses" and the average of those changes.
    Identified the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) and the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

PyPoll
Objective

Optimize the vote-counting process for a small town.
Key Achievements

    Counted the total number of votes cast.
    Compiled a complete list of candidates who received votes.
    Calculated the percentage of votes each candidate won.
    Determined the total number of votes each candidate won.
    Declared the winner of the election based on popular vote.
